# Blueflow

Blueflow is a collection of developer tools designed to streamline workflows for AI-assisted development and API management.

## Tools

### [Blueflow Chopper](./Blueflow.Chopper/README.md)
A specialized CLI utility designed to break down monolithic OpenAPI files into smaller, manageable YAML snippets. This is particularly useful for working with LLMs that have context window limits, allowing you to feed only the relevant parts of an API specification.
